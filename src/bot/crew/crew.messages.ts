  `Welcome to you new crew. You can join this crew by clicking the button below. You can leave again at any time by running the \`/echo crew leave\` command in this channel or optionally selecting the team in the command.
  
To run a successful crew you should do the following:
- Post a log (command or button) describing your goals. You should communicate what you are doing or a description of the crew, where you are doing it, necessary inputs, and outputs.
- Share any designs or plans in the channel for discussion.
- Advertise your crew elsewhere in the Discord so others can know to join you.
- Continue to provide updates (or logs) as goals are complete or new goals are created.`;
